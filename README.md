# 🏗️ Genesis_01: The Lee Automation Journey

> "I am building Lee Automation not just to write code, but to build a life of freedom for my family and faithfulness to God. Every line of code is a step toward freedom; every moment of study is an act of stewardship."

## 📖 Overview
**Genesis_01** is the foundational repository for the Lee Automation project. It marks the beginning of a structured journey to master Python, build efficient systems, and cultivate a life of discipline. This project is guided by the principles of stewardship and technical excellence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Resources
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Primary Guide:** *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes
* **System Design:** *How to Take Smart Notes* (Zettelkasten Method)
* **Habit Formation:** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
* **Daily Discipline:** Typing.com (Speed and Accuracy)

## 📅 The Study System
This repository tracks my progress through a 12-week intensive foundation phase:
* **Phase 1:** Python Fundamentals & Second Brain Setup.
* **Phase 2:** Logic, Classes, and Functional Programming.
* **Phase 3:** Real-world Applications (Web Apps, Data Vis, & Games).

## 🚀 Goals for Lee Automation
1.  **Freedom:** Building automated solutions to reclaim time for family.
2.  **Faithfulness:** Approaching every line of code as an act of service and stewardship.
3.  **Mastery:** Moving beyond "writing code" to architecting solutions.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
* `/exercises`: Chapter-by-chapter work from Python Crash Course.
* `/projects`: Larger automation scripts and applications.
* `/notes`: Insights gathered from *Smart Notes* and *Atomic Habits*.

### 💡 Week 2 Reflection: Data Systems
**The Big Picture:** This week, I moved from handling single variables to managing "inventories" of data. I learned that automation isn't just about speed; it's about **structure**.

**Key Wins:**
* **The Loop Engine:** I successfully built a loop that can process infinite items with just 3 lines of code. This is the "scale" I need for Lee Automation.
* **The Bracket Breakthrough:** I learned the hard way that `[]` (Lists) and `{}` (Dictionaries) are not the same. Debugging this error myself was a huge confidence boost.
* **The Narrator vs. Stuntman:** I now understand that `print()` is for testing logic, and real action (The Stuntman) happens later.

**Challenge for Next Week:**
* My goal for Week 3 is to master **If-Statements**. I want to teach my scripts to make decisions based on the data they find.
