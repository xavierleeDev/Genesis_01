# 🏗️ Genesis_01: The Lee Automation Journey

> "I am building Lee Automation not just to write code, but to build a life of freedom for my family and faithfulness to God. Every line of code is a step toward freedom; every moment of study is an act of stewardship."

## 📖 Overview
**Genesis_01** is the foundational repository for the Lee Automation project. It marks the beginning of a structured journey to master Python, build efficient systems, and cultivate a life of discipline. This project is guided by the principles of stewardship and technical excellence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Resources
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Primary Guide:** *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes
* **System Design:** *How to Take Smart Notes* (Zettelkasten Method)
* **Habit Formation:** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
* **Daily Discipline:** Typing.com (Speed and Accuracy)

## 📅 The Study System
This repository tracks my progress through a 12-week intensive foundation phase:
* **Phase 1:** Python Fundamentals & Second Brain Setup.
* **Phase 2:** Logic, Classes, and Functional Programming.
* **Phase 3:** Real-world Applications (Web Apps, Data Vis, & Games).

## 🚀 Goals for Lee Automation
1.  **Freedom:** Building automated solutions to reclaim time for family.
2.  **Faithfulness:** Approaching every line of code as an act of service and stewardship.
3.  **Mastery:** Moving beyond "writing code" to architecting solutions.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
* `/exercises`: Chapter-by-chapter work from Python Crash Course.
* `/projects`: Larger automation scripts and applications.
* `/notes`: Insights gathered from *Smart Notes* and *Atomic Habits*.
